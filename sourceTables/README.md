# Bible Transliterations Source Tables

These are the main tables for the Biblical Hebrew
and Koine Greek transliterations to English.

Both files are simple two-column TSV files
with the original language characters in the first column
and the English transliteration character in the second column.
We have tried to include both NFD and NFC forms
in the tables so that both will work.

We are open to extending these to other major and minor languages --
just submit a merge request.

We use the IETF BCP47 language tags --
see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag.
